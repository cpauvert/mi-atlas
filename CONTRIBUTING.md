# Contributing to mi-atlas

First of all, thank you for taking the time to look at how to improve this project (or perhaps looking at this document out of curiosity which is just as fine)! The following sections will lay out advices on how to contribute to this repository.

Contributions can be divided into two non-exclusive categories depending on the involvement and the acquaintance with the `git` suite (ordered from low to high):

1. Issue creation: for suggestions and problems reporting
2. Pull request: for potential *modification*

> **Not familiar with *git*, *pull request* or other incantations?**
>
> If you are not familiar with `git` or Github, it might be easier to go through the [quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github) put together by the Github team.
> If some terms seems too exotic, the [glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary) is the place to look for some sense.

## Contributions to the microbial interactions catalog

### With issues

[New issues](https://github.com/cpauvert/mi-atlas/issues/new) are welcome to suggest:

* to include an undocumented microbial interaction (using the `new-mi-entry` label)
* to increment or correct features regarding a documented microbial interaction (using respectively the labels `enhancement` and `invalid`)

There is no template for writing the issue but please state as precisely as possible the suggestion with the appropriate bibliography and doi. Issues in english are preferred but French is accepted.

### With pull requests

The `mi-atlas` project should be first *forked* in order to suggest any contributions with pull request (whether online through Github or in the command line).

The catalog is a tab-separated [file](https://github.com/cpauvert/mi-atlas/blob/main/mi-atlas.tsv), therefore any contributions to the catalog should modify this file (learn [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github/editing-files-in-another-users-repository) how to do it easily online).

New pull request are welcome for the same suggestion as the issues above and are expected to use the same labels.


## Contributions to the repository in general

Bugs, typos or new ideas regarding the repository are also welcome in the form of [new issues](https://github.com/cpauvert/mi-atlas/issues/new). Issues in english are preferred but pressing matters could be reported in French also. Applying the [default labels](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-labels#about-default-labels) such as `bug` or `enhancement` would be a convenient way to flag such contributions.
