# mi-atlas: a Microbial Interactions Atlas <img src="docs/content/extra/logo.png" align="right" width="155" height="179"/>

## Description

A framework was recently suggested to describe interactions occurring between microorganisms using the encoding of several (binary) features in order to build a catalog amenable to quantitative analyses ([Pacheco and Segrè, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnz125)).
Their initial effort described 74 interactions which were unfortunately available only in the Supplementary Material section of the article.
Therefore, [mi-atlas](https://github.com/cpauvert/mi-atlas) (pronounced `/'mi atlas/` like in Spanish) aims to:

1. propose an interactive exploration of the catalog and
2. enable versioned community contributions to the microbial interactions catalog

## Contributing

Contributions to the catalog in the form of corrections and/or new entries are welcome and possible. If you are interested, please have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Expected developments

Several [milestones](https://github.com/cpauvert/mi-atlas/milestones) are already set for incremental improvements of the two aims of the project.

*Spoiler alert*: a Shiny application will be used to render the multi-column catalog into human-readable entries upon selection of the interaction of interest. 
In the future, a builder will be designed to ease the addition of a new entry to the catalog that follows the framework guidelines.
And ideally new entries could be discussed and reviewed before acceptance using the [pull request review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews#about-pull-request-reviews) system.
